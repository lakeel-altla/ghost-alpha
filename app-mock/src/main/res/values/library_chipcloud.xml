    <string name="library_chipcloud_libraryDescription">An easy to use implementation of Google\'s Material Design \'Chip\' ui element. Version 3 was a fresh rewrite of the original quickly hacked together library, version 3.0.4 introduces support for images/avatars and the close icon and matches the Google spec. The previous iteration was becoming popular as an easy replacement for a dropdown/spinner with improved UX and more efficient use of screen real estate. Versions 3+ have an improved API with a fraction of the code. The biggest change is it\'s now not a custom Layout, it\'s a simple helper class that adds Chips to a supplied ViewGroup, complex layout is delegated to dedicated layout libraries such as FlexboxLayout.</string>
